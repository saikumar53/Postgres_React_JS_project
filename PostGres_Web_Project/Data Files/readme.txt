Data Generation:

The data is generated by using a python scipt. The following 3 files are used for generating the data and are stored in the Data Generation Scripts folder:
1. db.py - For generating the customer data and the credit card data
2. mortgage.py - For generating the mortage data
3. device.py - For generating the device data

The db.py is the generates a unique customer id and we have used a Faker API for generating the names and address for the customer. It then also generate a unique account and SSN number for a customer and stores eveything in a pandas dataframe and then this dataframe is converted into CSV(Comma seperated values) file.

The mortgage and devie files work similary and take into into consideration the column of Customer_ID in the customer file so that the data is generated for each customer.

All the 4 csv files are stored in the CSV Data Files folder.


Load and Cerate:

The csv files are loaded into hte postgre database using PgAdmin interface. The CSV can be directly inserted into the tables once created.

create.sql is used for creating the tables and load.sql is used for loading the data into the tables.

We have used the copy command for load since it is most efficient for bulk loading the data into the postgre database.
